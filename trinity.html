<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the small community, excellent professors, and beautiful campus. </p>

<p>I chose Trinity University because of it's beautiful campus and small community. I also liked that I would have the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research.</p>
<p>I am majoring in Psychology because I want to work as a counselor, focusing primarily on adolescences	who struggle with depression or anxiety disorders. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
